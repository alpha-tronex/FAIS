# FAIS — Summary for Clients

FAIS is a web application that helps manage court-related cases and financial affidavits. People who are part of a case (such as a petitioner or respondent) can sign in to see their cases, update their profile and contact information, and complete a financial affidavit—entering income, expenses, assets, and liabilities so that a standardized court-ready form can be generated. Administrators use a separate, protected area to manage users and cases: they can create and edit user accounts, assign people to cases, and when needed view or complete affidavits on behalf of a user. The system keeps sensitive data secure, supports password resets, and is designed to work with existing case and user data while presenting everything in a clear, consistent way.
